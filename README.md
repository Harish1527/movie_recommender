- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily extendable with additional data and advanced models.

## 📌 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask/Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Angular/Vue - optional)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Heroku, AWS, GCP

## 📌 Installation & Setup
